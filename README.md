First programming assignment in the course Web Programming II

All requirements are fulfilled, and then some. The features that are surplus to requirements are the following:
+ Clear button, which clears the canvas and removes all shapes from array (cannot be undone).
+ The user is able to select fill and outline colors.
+ The user is able to choose whether rectangles and circles are filled or only outlines (see 'Fill Shape' button)

##### Saving and loading
The user has to provide a username to login, and when he does he sees a list of the drawings he has saved (if any). When the name of the drawing he wants to load is clicked, it loads on the canvas. Then he can carry on where he left off. The server for saving and loading may be down.

##### A minor issue with small screens (e.g. 13 inches)
The list of drawings tends to drop down below the canvas on the right side. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Keep this in mind.
